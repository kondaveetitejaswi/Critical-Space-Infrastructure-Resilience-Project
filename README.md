# Critical-Space-Infrastructure-Resilience-Project
ðŸš€ Critical Space Infrastructure Resilience.

Goal:
To simulate a satellite system in RL environment where attacker and defender agents interact, and defenders learn optimal strategies to maintain or improve resilience against cyber-physical attacks.

Targets: 
* Environment Simulation
* State and Action space simulation
* Reward functions and elements designing
